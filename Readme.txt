This piece of software is created by Gaurav Mitra.

Notes :
		1. This code uses SCOPUS API. For more details about the API visit http://dev.elsevier.com . API key is needed.
		2. JAVA and PYTHON 2 is required to be present in the system.
		3. This is not a recursive crawler. To make it recursive we have to make necessary changes in the bash or batch file and it can be affected 
		   without changing the main code.
	
RUNNING THE SOFTWARE :
		1. In Linux Distributions : Just run the run-all.sh bash file.
		2. In Windows : Run the run-all.bat batch file.

DEVELOPMENTS :
		1. All the codes are individually tested. 
		2. It is designed in such a way such that if any modification is required later it can be affected by just changing the bash 
		   or batch file. We do not have to necessarily look into the code which is already written.
